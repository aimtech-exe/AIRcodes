Progress status:
 - DHT22 95%
 - kapton heaters 50%
 - cosmic watch 80% (transmitting data to Pi 3 and/or retrieving data from the sd card)
 - blv interface 50% (I2C connection)
 - Storing data into SD card 20%

Further testing needed:
 - cosmic watch should work properly and collect consistent data
 - SD card should have a stable, consistent data with very little outliers
 - heaters should be turned on when requested



Setup:
install both python 3 and pip.
Library needed:
